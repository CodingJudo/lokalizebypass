# Dev guidelines (Python)

- Python 3.11+.
- Type hints for public functions.
- Keep memory.jsonl stable and deterministic (sorted keys, stable ns extraction).
- Prefer JSONL streaming reads/writes; avoid loading everything unless necessary.
- Add unit tests for:
  - placeholder extraction/signature
  - merge-only-missing behavior
  - JSON schema validation
